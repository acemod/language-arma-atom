# Arma language support in Atom

This packages adds syntax highlighting and completions for SQF files in Atom, including functions and Macros from the [CBA](http://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3/) and [ACE3](http://github.com/acemod/ACE3/) projects. This package is maintained and developed by the [ACE3](http://ace3mod.com/) development team and the Arma community effort.

We have added support for the following file types used by the Real Virtuality engine:
- sqf
- sqm
- cfg
- ext

## Features

This package offers syntax highlighting and auto-completion for SQF.

### Syntax highlighting

We support syntax highlighting for all Bohemia Interactive functions and script commands. Next to that, we also support both CBA functions and Macros as well as ACE3 project macros.

### Auto Completion

To allow you to develop faster in SQF, we also added in auto-completion for all BI functions and script commands, as well as CBA and ACE3 functions and macros.

### Snippets

Quick development also requires writing a lot of different blocks or combinations of code. We have added a handful of useful snippets ranging from BI conditional structures and loops through CBA macros to ACE3 function headers to help you with this.
