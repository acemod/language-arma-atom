We have added support for the following file types used by the Real Virtuality engine:

## Features

This package offers syntax highlighting and auto-completion for SQF.

### Snippets

Quick development also requires writing a lot of different blocks or combinations of code, we added a handful of useful snippets ranging from BI conditional structures and loops through CBA macros to ACE3 function headers.
